# Notes
1. The repository consists of 4 lessons:  
    a. Who Wrote It folder for Number 1 : Lesson 7.2 Task 2  
    b. NotifyMe folder for Number 2 : Lesson 8.1 Task 2  
    c. DroidCafeWithSettings for Number 3 : Lesson 9.2 Task 2  
    d. MinimalistContentProvider for Number 4 part 1 : Lesson 11.1A Task 1  
    e. MinimalistContentProviderFinal and wordlistsqlwithcontentprovider for Number 4 part 2 : Lesson 11.1B Task 1  
    f. WordListClient and word_list_sql_with_content_provider for Number 4 part 3 : Lesson 11.1C Task 1  
  
2. My assumptions for this lessons are:  
    a. All the lessons are put in one folder, as last two week's exercise.  
    b. All the lessons are done without lessons learned.  
    c. There are some folders that don't match with the worbook's conventions, but I've already stated in this README.
